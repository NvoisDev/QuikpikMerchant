# WhatsApp Business Template Setup Guide

## Your Current Setup Analysis
‚úÖ **Phone Numbers**: All correctly formatted to international format (+447507659550)
‚úÖ **Twilio Integration**: Working with sandbox number +14155238886
‚úÖ **Message Templates**: You have "Stock Update" template with Olu Olu Plantain and Wireless Bluetooth Headphones
‚ùå **Business Templates**: Need WhatsApp Business approved templates for production

## Current Issue: WhatsApp Business Policy (Error 63016)
You're using Twilio Sandbox which only allows their pre-approved template: "Your appointment is coming up on July 21 at 3PM"

For your business messaging, you need approved WhatsApp Business templates.

## Step-by-Step Template Setup

### Step 1: WhatsApp Business Manager Setup
1. Go to **business.whatsapp.com**
2. Create/access your WhatsApp Business account
3. Navigate to **Message Templates** section

### Step 2: Create Your Business Templates

Based on your existing "Stock Update" template, here are recommended templates to create:

#### Template 1: Stock Notification
**Name**: `stock_notification`
**Category**: MARKETING
**Language**: English (UK)
**Template**:
```
Hello {{1}}! 

We have new stock available:
{{2}}

Contact us for pricing and orders.
Thank you!

{{3}}
```

**Variables**:
- {{1}} = Customer name
- {{2}} = Product names  
- {{3}} = Business name

#### Template 2: Product Update
**Name**: `product_update`  
**Category**: MARKETING
**Language**: English (UK)
**Template**:
```
üõçÔ∏è New Products Available!

{{1}} now has fresh stock:

{{2}}

üìû Contact: {{3}}
```

**Variables**:
- {{1}} = Business name
- {{2}} = Product details
- {{3}} = Phone number

### Step 3: Update Your Quikpik Templates
Once WhatsApp approves your templates (24-48 hours), I'll update your system to use them.

### Step 4: Production Twilio Setup
1. **Upgrade to Twilio Production** (move away from sandbox)
2. **Verify your WhatsApp Business number** with Twilio
3. **Connect approved templates** to Twilio

## Immediate Solution Options

### Option A: Continue with Sandbox (Limited)
- Only sends approved Twilio messages
- Good for testing phone formatting
- Cannot send business content

### Option B: Move to Production (Recommended)
- Requires WhatsApp Business account
- Can use custom approved templates
- Full business messaging capability

### Option C: Use Simple Messages
Current implementation uses simplified messages that may work better:
"Hello! [Business] has new stock available: [Products]. Contact us for pricing and orders."

## Your Next Actions
1. **Apply for WhatsApp Business account** at business.whatsapp.com
2. **Create the templates above** in WhatsApp Business Manager
3. **Wait for approval** (24-48 hours)
4. **Let me know when approved** - I'll integrate them into your system
