User Portal and Wholesaler Access



For the multi-wholesaler platform, here's how to structure the user portal and wholesaler access:



Unique User Accounts: Each customer should have one unique account, tied to their email address or telephone. This prevents a customer from having multiple logins.



Wholesaler-Specific Permissions: A customer's account should be linked to specific wholesalers. When a wholesaler invites a customer, their unique ID (e.g., email or telephone) is added to that wholesaler's list of authorized users.



Login and Redirection: When a customer logs in, the system checks which wholesalers they're associated with. If they're linked to only Wholesaler A, they're redirected to A's customer portal. If they're linked to both A and B, they will be presented with a choice on a central dashboard to access either A's portal or B's portal (find seller).



Key Considerations 

Database Structure:

Users Table: This table holds a single record for each customer with their telephone number or email

Wholesalers Table: This table stores information about each wholesaler.

Relationships Table: A many-to-many relationship table is crucial. It links users to wholesalers. This table should have columns like customer_id, wholesaler_id, and join_date to manage the connections.

User Invitation Flow:

When a wholesaler invites a customer, the system should check if the customer's email or telephone already exists in the users table.

If the user exists: The system creates a new entry in the relationships table, linking the existing customer_id to the inviting wholesaler_id.

If the customer does not exist: The system creates a new user record and then links it to the inviting wholesaler in the relationships table.

Security and Data Isolation:

Ensure that a customer can only see products, prices, and order history from the specific wholesaler they're currently accessing within the customer portal

The backend logic must strictly filter all data queries based on the wholesaler_id associated with the current user session to prevent data from being exposed to the wrong customer.

Scalability:

The architecture should be able to handle thousands of wholesalers and millions of customer relationships without performance degradation. Using efficient database indexing and a well-structured schema is key.
