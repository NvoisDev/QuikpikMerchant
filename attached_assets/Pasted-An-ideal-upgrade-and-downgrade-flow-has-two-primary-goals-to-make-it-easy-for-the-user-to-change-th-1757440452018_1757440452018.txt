An ideal upgrade and downgrade flow has two primary goals: to make it easy for the user to change their plan and to clearly communicate what that change means for their access and billing.  
Upgrade Flow + UI Design
The upgrade flow should be frictionless and centered on value.  
• Entry Point: The "upgrade" option should be prominently featured in the user's dashboard or settings, especially when they encounter a feature limit (e.g., trying to add an 11th product on a Free plan).
• Pricing Page UI: The pricing page should clearly show the current plan and highlight the benefits of the higher tiers. Use a comparison table to show what's included in each plan.  
• Clear Call-to-Action: The button on the higher tier should be an unmistakable "Upgrade Now" button.
• Confirmation & Proration: After the user confirms, the UI should display a clear summary of the transaction, including the new total and any prorated charge (the difference in cost for the remainder of the billing cycle). This builds trust by showing the exact amount they're being billed.  
Downgrade Flow + UI Design
The downgrade flow is about respecting the user's choice while minimizing churn.
• Entry Point: The "downgrade" option should be accessible, but not as prominent as the upgrade button. It's often found in a "Manage Subscription" section.
• Confirmation & Value Reinforcement: When a user selects a lower tier, a confirmation modal should appear. This is a crucial moment to reinforce the value they're losing. The modal should show a list of features they will lose or that will become "locked" after the downgrade is complete (e.g., "You will lose access to unlimited products and advanced analytics").
• Billing Cycle Timing: It is a best practice to keep the user on their current plan until the end of the billing cycle. The confirmation should clearly state that the downgrade will take effect on their next renewal date and no new charges will be made until then.
• No Downgrade Penalty: Downgrading should not incur any immediate charges. Instead, Stripe will apply a credit to the user's account for any unused time on their old plan, which will be applied to future invoices.
Ideal UI Elements to Use
• Comparison Table: A side-by-side table that clearly outlines the features and limits of each plan is essential. Use checkmarks for included features and clear numbers for limits (e.g., "10 Products," "Unlimited Products").  
• "Your Current Plan" Label: Clearly label the user's current plan with a distinct badge or color to orient them on the pricing page.
• Sticky Header: On a long pricing page, keep the plan options visible at the top as the user scrolls.  
• Confirmation Modal: Use a modal pop-up for both upgrades and downgrades to require the user to actively confirm their decision and to present important billing and feature information.
