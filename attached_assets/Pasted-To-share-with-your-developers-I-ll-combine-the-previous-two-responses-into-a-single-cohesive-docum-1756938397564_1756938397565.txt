To share with your developers, I'll combine the previous two responses into a single, cohesive document. It will cover the step-by-step guide for the Stripe Connect checkout process with delivery addresses and the additional considerations.
Guide to Stripe Connect Checkout with Delivery Addresses
This guide outlines a step-by-step process and best practices for building a robust Stripe Connect checkout with delivery address management.
Step 1: Backend Data Model
Your database schema is the foundation. It must be designed to handle multiple addresses per user and store the specific delivery address for each order.
 * User Address Table: This table stores addresses for a user.
   * id
   * user_id (links to your users)
   * address_line1, address_line2, city, state, postal_code, country
   * is_default (boolean)
 * Order Table: This table stores a copy of the final delivery address used for a specific order.
   * id
   * user_id
   * wholesaler_id
   * delivery_address_id (foreign key)
   * delivery_address_line1, delivery_city, etc.
Step 2: Backend Logic for Checkout Session
This is the core of the process. Your backend must handle the address data and create the Stripe session correctly.
 * Receive Request: An endpoint on your server (e.g., /create-checkout-session) receives the customer's order and their chosen delivery address ID or a new address.
 * Validate and Retrieve Address: Retrieve the address from the database and perform a crucial security check to ensure the user_id on the address matches the logged-in user.
 * Create Stripe Checkout Session: Use the Stripe API to create a checkout.sessions object.
   * Use the shipping_address_collection and shipping_details parameters to pre-populate the address.
   * Add metadata to the session with the delivery_address_id and a copy of the full address. This will be used later for reconciliation.
   * Stripe Connect: When creating the session, include the Stripe-Account header with the ID of the wholesaler's connected account.
Step 3: Handling Stripe Webhooks
Webhooks are the only reliable way to confirm an order.
 * Listen for checkout.session.completed: Your server needs a webhook handler to listen for this event.
 * Verify the Webhook: Always verify the webhook signature to ensure it's a legitimate request from Stripe.
 * Process the Order:
   * Retrieve the checkout.session object from the webhook payload.
   * Extract the address details from the session's metadata.
   * Create a new order record in your Order Table and save the final delivery address details from the webhook payload.
Step 4: The Order Details View
The front-end must display the correct delivery address to the customer and the wholesaler.
 * Customer and Wholesaler Views: When an order is viewed, the front-end should pull the address details directly from the Order Table, not from the user's saved addresses. This ensures the address displayed is the one used for that specific transaction.
Additional Considerations
 * User Experience (UX): The front-end should provide a smooth experience, with dynamic forms for adding new addresses and clear error messages.
 * Payment and Shipping Logic: Use Stripe's shipping_options and tax features for a more robust solution. The cost of shipping can be passed into the session and tied to the delivery address.
 * Security & Data Integrity:
   * Never trust the client. Always re-validate data on the backend.
   * The webhook signature must always be verified.
   * Once an order is placed, the delivery address should be considered immutable to prevent data inconsistency.
 * Edge Cases: Be prepared for things to go wrong. Your system should handle webhook failures and browser closures after payment gracefully. Use idempotency keys to prevent duplicate charges.
