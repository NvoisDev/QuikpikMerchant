User Portal and Wholesaler Access
For your multi-wholesaler platform, here's how to structure the user portal and wholesaler access:

Unique User Accounts: Each customer should have one unique account, likely tied to their email address. This prevents a customer from having multiple logins.

Wholesaler-Specific Permissions: A customer's account should be linked to specific wholesalers. When a wholesaler invites a customer, their unique ID (e.g., email) is added to that wholesaler's list of authorized users.

Login and Redirection: When a customer logs in, your system checks which wholesalers they're associated with. If they're linked to only Wholesaler A, they're redirected to A's customer portal. If they're linked to both A and B, they will be presented with a choice on a central dashboard to access either A's portal or B's portal.

Key Considerations for the Developer
Database Structure:

Users Table: This table holds a single record for each customer with their unique email and password.

Wholesalers Table: This table stores information about each wholesaler.

Relationships Table: A many-to-many relationship table is crucial. It links users to wholesalers. This table should have columns like user_id, wholesaler_id, and join_date to manage the connections.

User Invitation Flow:

When a wholesaler invites a customer, the system should check if the customer's email already exists in the users table.

If the user exists: The system creates a new entry in the relationships table, linking the existing user_id to the inviting wholesaler_id.

If the user does not exist: The system creates a new user record and then links it to the inviting wholesaler in the relationships table.

Security and Data Isolation:

Ensure that a customer can only see products, prices, and order history from the specific wholesaler they're currently accessing.

The backend logic must strictly filter all data queries based on the wholesaler_id associated with the current user session to prevent data from being exposed to the wrong customer.

Scalability:

The architecture should be able to handle thousands of wholesalers and millions of customer relationships without performance degradation. Using efficient database indexing and a well-structured schema is key.
