Based on your screenshots, here is an ideal order timeline that covers all key events from payment to fulfillment, structured for both the wholesaler and the customer view.
Ideal Order Timeline
The timeline should clearly track the order's journey in a chronological, step-by-step manner. Use a green dot for completed steps and a grey dot for pending steps.
Timeline for the Wholesaler
The wholesaler's timeline should provide a clear checklist of actions they need to take.
 * Order Received: Payment has been successfully processed and the order is in your system. This step should be automated upon successful payment.
 * Order Items Prepared: The wholesaler has to manually confirm they have prepared the items for collection or delivery.
 * Ready for Collection/Delivery: The wholesaler confirms the order is packaged and ready. This triggers the notification to the customer.
 * Order Fulfilled: The final action, marking the order as complete. This happens after the customer has picked up the order or after it has been delivered.
Timeline for the Customer
The customer's timeline provides status updates and builds trust. The events are triggered by the system or by the wholesaler's actions.
 * Payment Processed: Confirms the payment has been successfully received.
 * Order Confirmation Sent: Confirms that the customer has received their order details and receipt.
 * Wholesaler Notified of Your Order: Lets the customer know the wholesaler is aware of the order and is starting to prepare it.
 * Order Ready for Collection/Delivery: A crucial step that tells the customer they can now pick up their order or that it is ready to be shipped.
 * Order Fulfilled: The final step, confirming the order is complete.
How to Implement This
 * Database: Add a status field to your orders table. The values could be payment_received, items_prepared, ready_for_collection, and fulfilled.
 * User Interface: The UI should read the status of the order to determine which steps to display with a green dot.
 * Actions: Add buttons to the wholesalerâ€™s order detail page that change the order status (e.g., a "Mark as Ready" button). When the wholesaler clicks this, it updates the database, changes the timeline for both parties, and triggers any relevant notifications.
