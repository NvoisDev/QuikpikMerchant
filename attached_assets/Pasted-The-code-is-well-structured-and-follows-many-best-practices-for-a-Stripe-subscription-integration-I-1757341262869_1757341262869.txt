The code is well-structured and follows many best practices for a Stripe subscription integration. It correctly uses environment variables and separates concerns into clear functions. Here's a review with some suggestions for improvement.
Key Strengths of the Code
 * Environmental Variables: The use of process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is correct and secure.
 * Modularity: The functions are well-named and have single responsibilities, which is great for readability and maintenance.
 * Idempotency: The createOrUpdateStripeCustomer function correctly handles the creation of a Stripe customer, but it should include logic to first check if a customer already exists to prevent duplicates.
 * Webhooks: The code correctly saves userId and priceId in the metadata of the checkout session, which is the correct way to link the Stripe session back to your application's user via webhooks.
Suggestions for Improvement
 * Stripe Products: It's generally better to retrieve Stripe Product IDs from the API instead of hardcoding them. Hardcoding can lead to bugs if the product IDs change. A better approach is to store a unique identifier (like tier: 'standard') in the product's metadata in Stripe and then filter based on that.
 * Webhooks are Missing: The code doesn't show a webhook handler. This is the most critical component of a subscription system. Without webhooks, you cannot reliably track a user's subscription status after the initial purchase.
 * Customer Existence Check: The createOrUpdateStripeCustomer function doesn't check if a customer with that email or userId already exists. It should perform a lookup first and only create a new customer if one doesn't exist. Otherwise, you'll create duplicate Stripe customers for the same user.
 * Error Handling: The getAvailablePlans function will fail if a price.product is not expanded. The expand option is good, but the code should handle the case where the expansion fails.
 * success_url and cancel_url: The current URLs redirect the user back to the dashboard, which is fine, but they don't provide a way to handle the fulfillment logic. This logic should be handled by a webhook, not a redirect.
