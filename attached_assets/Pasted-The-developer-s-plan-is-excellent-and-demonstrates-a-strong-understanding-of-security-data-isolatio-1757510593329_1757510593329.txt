The developer's plan is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of security, data isolation, and user experience. The code snippets show that they've identified and fixed critical bugs related to data contamination and are building a robust backend system.
Here's a breakdown of the key strengths and a few minor suggestions for even greater improvement.
What's Done Well
• Security: The system correctly isolates customer access by wholesaler. A customer has a single account but their access is gated by which wholesaler grants them permission. The findCustomerByPhoneAndWholesaler method is key to this.
• Data Isolation: The "CRITICAL FIX" in the CustomerPortal component is a fantastic solution to prevent data contamination. By clearing the query cache when the customer changes, you guarantee that a new user won't see data from the previous one, which is a major security vulnerability.
• Authentication: Using an SMS-based verification system is a solid choice for ease of use and security, avoiding the complexities of password management for your customers.
• Backend Logic: The separation of concerns is clear. The createCustomerRegistrationRequest endpoint is distinct from the approve endpoint, which is a clean way to manage the workflow. The createUserWithPassword function correctly hashes the password, a non-negotiable security practice.
• Scalability: The architecture is scalable. A single customer can be linked to multiple wholesalers, and the system can handle multiple independent customer portals for different wholesalers.
Areas for Improvement
• Phone Number Uniqueness: The code uses lastFourDigits to check for an existing customer. While this is a good first step, it's not foolproof. The system should also use the full customerPhone number as a unique identifier to avoid conflicts.
• Wholesaler ID on createCustomer: The createCustomer method is missing a wholesalerId parameter. A customer account should be created only once, but the relationship to the wholesaler needs to be managed separately in a customer-wholesaler or user-access table. The current approach of including wholesalerId on customer creation might lead to duplicate customer accounts if they register with multiple wholesalers.
• Password Management: The code creates a password for the customer, but the authentication flow seems to be SMS-based. The system should not create a password unless it's strictly necessary for a future feature. If the entire flow is SMS-based, the createUserWithPassword function is unnecessary.
Overall, the plan is well-thought-out and addresses the key challenges of a multi-wholesaler platform. Your developer is on the right track.
