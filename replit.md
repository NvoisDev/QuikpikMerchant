## Payment and Shipping Structure

### Customer-Driven Shipping System
The platform implements a customer-centric shipping model where customers control shipping choices and costs:

#### Shipping Options
- **Pickup (Free)**: Customers can collect orders from wholesaler location at no cost
- **Delivery (Paid)**: Customers choose from available courier services and pay shipping costs directly

#### Payment Breakdown
- **Product Subtotal**: Total cost of products in cart
- **Shipping Cost**: Customer-selected courier service charge (if delivery chosen)
- **Platform Fee**: 5% automatically calculated on product subtotal only (not shipping)
- **Total**: Product subtotal + shipping cost + platform fee

#### Shipping Quote Process
1. Customer completes delivery address during checkout
2. System fetches real-time quotes from multiple carriers (Royal Mail, DPD, Evri)
3. Customer selects preferred service based on price and delivery time
4. Shipping cost is added to order total at checkout
5. Wholesaler receives notification of shipping preference

#### Cost Responsibility
- **Customers**: Pay for shipping costs they select
- **Wholesalers**: Receive 95% of product value (after 5% platform fee)
- **Platform**: Collects 5% fee on product sales only

This approach gives customers control over delivery speed and cost while ensuring wholesalers focus on product pricing rather than shipping logistics.
