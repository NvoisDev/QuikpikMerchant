### CONTACT WHOLESALER BUTTON FIX - COMPLETED ✅ (July 21, 2025)

- **Solution Implemented**: Updated all Contact Wholesaler buttons to use `window.location.href = '/'` for proper navigation to landing page
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - **Fixed Locations**: All 5 instances in customer-portal.tsx updated:
    - Line 93: Guest mode price overlay "Sign In" button

### LOGOUT AUTHENTICATION STATE FIX - COMPLETED ✅ (July 21, 2025)

- **Root Cause**: Authentication state wasn't immediately clearing during logout, causing router timing issues where `isAuthenticated` returned true momentarily
- **Solution Implemented**: Enhanced logout function with comprehensive state clearing and immediate authentication reset
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - **Immediate State Clear**: `queryClient.setQueryData(["/api/auth/user"], null)` to instantly clear authentication
  - **Complete Cache Clear**: `queryClient.clear()` to remove all cached data
  - **Storage Cleanup**: `localStorage.clear()` and `sessionStorage.clear()` to ensure no persistent state

### SMS VERIFICATION DEBUGGING SOLUTION - COMPLETED ✅ (July 21, 2025)

  - **Logout Flow**: Clear localStorage → Reset authentication state → Show logout toast → Redirect to landing page

  - **Production Ready**: Logout functionality now properly returns users to home page
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Logout redirect working correctly

### URL ENCODING ISSUE RESOLUTION - COMPLETED ✅ (July 21, 2025)
