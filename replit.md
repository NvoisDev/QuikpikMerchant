## Previous Changes (Version Control 13 - August 26, 2025)
MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGIC BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE COMPLETE: Successfully implemented advanced business intelligence capabilities including comprehensive customer insights service with behavioral analytics, dynamic pricing optimization based on demand patterns, and marketplace expansion opportunities identification.

Platform now maintains zero development-time warnings ensuring production stability and developer experience excellence.

## Previous Changes (Version Control 10 - August 21, 2025)
CRITICAL DATA ISOLATION SECURITY BREACH FULLY RESOLVED: Eliminated all hardcoded wholesaler IDs from API endpoints that allowed unauthorized cross-tenant data access. Fixed `/api/public-orders`, `/api/orders-light`, `/api/orders-paginated` endpoints to require proper authentication. Updated frontend components to use authenticated requests with credentials. Removed insecure fallback endpoints that bypassed authentication. Fixed auth recovery endpoint hardcoded ID. Result: Users can now only access their own data - complete data isolation achieved across all wholesaler accounts.

CRITICAL CUSTOMER ACCESS CONTROL BUG FIXED: Resolved critical security issue where customers could access any wholesaler platform regardless of their actual registration status. Fixed SQL operator precedence bug in findCustomerByLastFourDigits function that allowed customers to bypass proper access controls. Added proper parentheses to ensure wholesaler ID filtering applies correctly. Customer access is now properly restricted - customers can only access wholesaler platforms they're actually registered with.

CUSTOMER REGISTRATION REQUEST SYSTEM COMPLETE: Implemented comprehensive registration request system for unregistered customers. Features include professional dialog form with name, business name, phone, email and message fields, automatic email notifications to wholesalers, API validation with duplicate prevention, and clear user experience messaging. When customers try to access wholesaler platforms they're not registered with, they now see helpful registration request form instead of basic error messages.

BIDIRECTIONAL CUSTOMER PROFILE SYNC COMPLETE: Successfully implemented end-to-end synchronization between customer portal and wholesaler platform. Fixed critical data flow issues where business name updates in customer portal were not appearing in wholesaler edit dialogs. Updated Customer interface definitions across all files (customers.tsx, customer-address-book.tsx, customer-groups.tsx) to include businessName field. Modified database queries in getAllCustomers to fetch business_name column and map to businessName property. Authentication issues resolved for customer profile updates. Real-time sync confirmed working: customer portal changes immediately reflect in all wholesaler platform customer management screens.

COMPREHENSIVE CUSTOMER EDITING UNIFORMITY: Implemented standardized customer editing across ALL wholesaler platform dialogs. Every customer edit function now includes consistent comprehensive fields: firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, email, and businessName. Updated customer editing in Customer Directory, Customer Groups, and Customer Address Book to provide complete profile management capabilities. This ensures wholesalers have full visibility and editing control over customer information regardless of where they access it from in the platform.

BLUE BACKGROUND WIDTH FIX: Fixed MOQ helper messages (Minimum X units required) to use inline-block styling instead of full-width, ensuring the blue background only extends to the text content width rather than spanning the entire screen.

CUSTOMER PORTAL ACCOUNT SETTINGS EDIT FEATURE: Complete profile editing functionality implemented directly in the customer portal Account Settings tab. Features include edit button that transforms read-only profile display into editable form with Name, Email, Phone, and Business Name fields. Includes proper save/cancel controls with real-time validation and backend API endpoint (/api/customer-profile/update) for secure profile updates. Profile changes automatically sync with existing automated wholesaler notification system.

MOBILE-FRIENDLY LOGO UPLOAD SYSTEM COMPLETE: Implemented comprehensive logo upload system with mobile-optimized modal interface. Features include drag-and-drop support, camera integration for mobile devices, gallery selection, real-time preview, upload progress tracking, and validation. Object storage configured for secure file handling. Logo upload modal provides touch-friendly interface with options to take photos or select from gallery, automatic file validation, and seamless integration with business settings.
