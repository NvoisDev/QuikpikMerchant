# Quikpik Merchant - Wholesale B2B Platform

## Overview
Quikpik is a comprehensive B2B wholesale platform designed to empower businesses in managing products, customers, orders, and marketing campaigns, primarily through WhatsApp integration. It aims to streamline wholesale operations, enhance communication with customers, and provide robust tools for business growth and market expansion. The platform focuses on providing an e-commerce-style order viewing experience for customers and robust backend management for wholesalers, including multi-wholesaler data isolation and a reliable webhook system for order processing.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Maximum simplicity for both customer and wholesaler portals. Remove complexity, reduce authentication methods, streamline all features.

## System Architecture
### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite.
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query).
- **Routing**: Wouter.
- **Styling**: CSS variables with custom green brand colors.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Default table layout for orders with smart search and filtering, dynamic delivery method display, simplified interfaces, and consistent brand-integrated clean design with green theme colors. Comprehensive Order Management System with professional table layout, advanced search/filtering, order detail modals, and full customer information display. Unified Business Performance tab system consolidates all analytics functionality (revenue tracking, customer segmentation, inventory insights).
### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with structured error handling.
- **Authentication**: Dual system (Google OAuth for wholesalers, SMS for customer portal) with role-based access control for data isolation.
- **Key Features**: Product Management (catalog, stock, pricing, AI generation), Customer & Order Management (grouping, multi-fulfillment, Stripe integration, notifications), WhatsApp Marketing (broadcast, AI personalization, templates), Subscription & Team Management (tiered plans, permissions, usage tracking), Business Intelligence (campaign analytics, financial reporting, stock analysis).
- **Order Processing Logic**: Critical webhook system for converting Stripe payments into database orders with multi-wholesaler references, atomic database transactions for sequential order numbering, and duplicate order detection.
- **Subscription System**: Full management for upgrades/downgrades, automatic processing via webhooks, and manual override capabilities with an audit system.
- **Security**: Bcryptjs for password hashing, comprehensive role-based access control, and data isolation between wholesalers.
- **Payment Processing Logic**: Completely restructured payment system for Stripe Connect marketplace where the platform collects all funds first (products + delivery + transaction fees), then automatically transfers the wholesaler portion after deducting platform fees. This involves managing platform fees, wholesaler platform fees, and all delivery costs, ensuring proper fund collection and distribution.
### Data Storage
